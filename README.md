# How to Play
1. Players: The game supports 2-4 players.
2. Objective: The first player to reach the "Home" (position 100) wins.
3. Initial Roll: Each player must roll a 1 to start the game.
4. Turn-Based Play: Players take turns rolling the dice. The dice determines how many cells a player will move forward.
5. Snakes: If a player lands on a snake's head, they slide down to the snake's tail.
6. Ladders: If a player lands at the bottom of a ladder, they climb up to the top.

- Players bounce back if their roll takes them past position 100.
- Rolling a 1 gives the player an extra roll.
# Game Rules
- Starting: Each player must roll a 1 to leave the starting cell.
- Snakes: Landing on a snake’s head causes the player to move down to the snake’s tail.
- Ladders: Landing at the base of a ladder allows the player to move up to the top of the ladder.
- Winning: The player who reaches exactly 100 wins. If a player overshoots position 100, they bounce back by the excess amount.
- Turns: Players take turns rolling the dice. Rolling a 1 allows for an extra roll.
